#  Panthers Ready for Another Run at the NFL Playoffs

The Carolina Panthers had a disappointing end to their 2017 season, losing in the Wild Card round to the New Orleans Saints. But they are primed for a return trip to the playoffs in 2018.

The Panthers will have a strong offense led by quarterback Cam Newton and wide receiver Devin Funchess. They also have a solid defense, led by linebacker Luke Kuechly.

The Panthers should be one of the top teams in the NFC this year, and they will be a tough opponent for any team in the playoffs.

#  Panthers Aim to Bounce Back After Disappointing 2016 Season

After a disappointing 2016 season in which the Panthers missed the playoffs for the first time since 2011, the team looks to rebound in 2017.

The Panthers had high expectations heading into last season, but things quickly went awry. Injuries played a role in their struggles, as quarterback Cam Newton and linebacker Luke Kuechly both missed time with concussions. The team also struggled to generate a consistent pass rush, finishing with just 36 sacks on the year.

This year, the Panthers hope to get back on track with Newton and Kuechly healthy and a revamped defensive line. Carolina drafted edge rusher Charles Harris in the first round of this year's draft, and he is expected to help improve the pass rush. The Panthers also signed defensive end Julius Peppers, who should add some much-needed veteran leadership to the defense.

On offense, Newton will look to build on his MVP season from 2015. He'll have plenty of weapons at his disposal, including receivers Kelvin Benjamin and Devin Funchess, as well as running backs Christian McCaffrey and Jonathan Stewart. If Newton can stay healthy and productive this season, the Panthers should be contenders for the NFC Championship.

#  Cam Newton and Company Announces 2017 Preseason Schedule 

The Carolina Panthers released their preseason schedule today. The defending NFC Champions will open up the preseason at Bank of America Stadium against the Houston Texans on August 9th. The Panthers will then head to Tennessee to take on the Titans on August 18th. They will wrap up the preseason at home against the New England Patriots on August 26th.

This year's preseason should be very interesting for the Panthers. Quarterback Cam Newton is coming back from shoulder surgery and will be looking to get some reps in before the start of the regular season. The preseason will also give other players a chance to step up and show what they can do.

The Panthers open up the 2017 regular season at home against the Dallas Cowboys on September 10th.

#  Carolina Panthers 2017 Roster Analysis

The Carolina Panthers come into the 2017 season with some big changes. Gone are longtime Panthers such as wide receiver Steve Smith Sr., cornerback Josh Norman, and defensive end Jared Allen. In their place are new players such as rookie running back Christian McCaffrey and veteran tight end Greg Olsen. The Panthers will also be relying on some young players to step up and fill key roles, including quarterback Cam Newton, linebacker Luke Kuechly, and cornerback James Bradberry.

Here is a breakdown of the Carolina Panthers' 2017 roster:

Quarterback:

The Panthers' starter at quarterback is Cam Newton, who is coming off a disappointing 2016 season. Newton will need to put up better numbers if the Panthers are going to return to the playoffs. Backup quarterbacks are Derek Anderson and Joe Webb.

Running back:

Christian McCaffrey was selected by the Panthers in the first round of the 2017 NFL Draft. He is expected to be used mainly as a runner and a receiver out of the backfield. Jonathan Stewart returns as the team's starting running back. He missed seven games last season due to injury but is expected to be healthy for the start of this season. Other running backs on the roster include Fozzy Whittaker, Cameron Artis-Payne, and Brandon Wegher.

Wide receiver:

The Panthers' top three receivers from last season all left in free agency (Kelvin Benjamin, Ted Ginn Jr., and Devin Funchess). The team signed veteran wide receivers Torrey Smith and Russell Shepard in free agency. Other wide receivers on the roster include Curtis Samuel (a second-round pick in this year's draft), Damiere Byrd, Austin Duke, and Keyarris Garrett.

Tight end:

The Panthers' top two tight ends from last season (Greg Olsen and Ed Dickson) both departed via free agency. The team signed veteran tight end Jeremy Maclin in free agency and also drafted rookie tight end Ian Thomas. Other tight ends on the roster include Chris Manhertz and Levine Toilolo.

Offensive line:

The offensive line was a bit of a weak spot for the Panthers last season. They lost two starters in free agency (guard Andrew Norwell and center Ryan Kalil). The team signed guard Jeremiah Sirles and center Tyler Larsen in free agency, but they are unlikely to be able to fill the shoes of Norwell and Kalil. The other starters on the offensive line are tackle Michael Oher, tackle Matt Kalil (Tyler's brother), guard Trai Turner, and guard Amini Silatolu.



          

Defensive line:

The defensive line was one of Carolina's strengths last season. Losing Jared Allen in free agency will hurt, but they still have Star Lotulelei, Kawann Short, Mario Addison, Charles Johnson, Vernon Butler, Daeshon Hall, Wes Horton, Kyle Love,and Bryan Cox Jr.. Linebacker: Luke Kuechly is one of the best linebackers in the NFL and leads what is still a good group of linebackers for Carolina despite losing AFAIL Thomas Davis Jr.. Shaq Thompson returns as a starting linebacker along with David Mayo and Ben Jacobs. Cornerback: The cornerback position was a big weakness for Carolina last season, but they made some improvements this offseason by signing Bashaud Breeland in free agency and drafting Donte Jackson in the second round of this year's draft. Safety: The safety position was another weak spot for Carolina last season. They lost Kurt Coleman in free agency but signed Mike Adams as his replacement

#  NFL Picks Week 1 Carolina Panthers at Denver Broncos

The Carolina Panthers and Denver Broncos will kick off the NFLâ€™s regular season on Thursday, September 8 at Sports Authority Field at Mile High. The Panthers are coming off a Super Bowl appearance, while the Broncos are looking to rebound from a disappointing season.

The Panthers offense is led by quarterback Cam Newton, who had an MVP-caliber season last year. Newton will be throwing to Pro Bowl wide receivers Kelvin Benjamin and Greg Olsen, as well as superstar tight end Greg Olsen. The Broncos defense is led by Super Bowl MVP linebacker Von Miller.

The Broncos are favored to win this game by 3 points. However, I believe that the Panthers will come out victorious. They have a more balanced offense and a much better defense.
