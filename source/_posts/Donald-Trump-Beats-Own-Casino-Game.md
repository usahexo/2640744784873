#  Donald Trump Beats Own Casino Game

The billionaire businessman and international celebrity, Donald Trump is known for his business acumen, real estate holdings and successful television show, The Apprentice. Trump is also the owner of several world-renowned casinos, including Trump Taj Mahal in Atlantic City.

The story of how Donald Trump became a casino mogul is an interesting one. In 1988, he purchased the unfinished Trump Taj Mahal casino in Atlantic City from bankruptcy court for $1 million. He then put in over $100 million of his own money to finish construction and open the casino. The gamble paid off and the casino turned a profit within months of opening.

Donald Trump followed up this success by purchasing the bankrupt Plaza Hotel in New York City for $407 million in 1995. He then spent another $50 million renovating the hotel. Again, this investment proved to be a wise one and the Plaza Hotel is now worth an estimated $1 billion.

Perhaps Donald Trump's most successful foray into the casino business was his purchase of the Trump Marina casino in Atlantic City in 2001. He purchased it from bankruptcy court for just $38 million and renamed it the Trump Marina Casino. In 2010, he sold it for $316 million, making a tidy profit of over $278 million on his original investment.

Trump's success as a casino owner has not been without controversy, however. In 2009, he filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection for three of his casinos: Trump Entertainment Resorts,Trump Taj Mahal and Trump Plaza Hotel & Casino. However, he emerged from bankruptcy after just four months, vowing to never again do business with his former partners at those casinos.

Despite these setbacks, Donald Trump's casino empire continues to thrive and he remains one of the most successful businessmen in the world today.
