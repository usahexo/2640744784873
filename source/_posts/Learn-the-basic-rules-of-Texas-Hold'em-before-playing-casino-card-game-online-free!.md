#  Learn the basic rules of Texas Hold'em before playing casino card game online free!

Texas Hold'em is one of the most popular casino card games that you can play online free. The objective of the game is to make the best five-card hand using any combination of your two hole cards and the five community cards. To get started, each player is dealt two cards face down, also known as hole cards. Then, five community cards are placed in the middle of the table, face up. The player with the best hand at the end of the game wins!

There are a few basic rules that you need to know before playing Texas Hold'em:

* In Texas Hold'em, the Ace is high and the Two is low.

* The rank of hands from highest to lowest are as follows: Royal Flush, Straight Flush, Four of a Kind, Full House, Flush, Straight, Three of a Kind, Two Pair, and One Pair. A High Card hand has no rank and is determined by the highest card in the hand.

* To begin a round of betting, each player must "ante" up by placing a small bet into the pot before receiving their cards. After all players have placed their ante bets, each player is given their two hole cards. The first player to act is always determined by who has the highest ranked starting hand - ace high or higher - and this player has three options: Bet (put in more money), Check (pass without betting), or Fold (give up). Once this first player either bets or checks, then all other players have the same options in turn clockwise around the table until everyone has either folded or put in money equal to the last bet made. If no one raises (e.g., all players check), then this completes that particular round of betting and proceeds to the next stage. 

* The second stage of betting begins once all players have received their Hole Cards and consists of three further rounds: fourth street (first four community cards), fifth street (second four community cards), and sixth street (final three community cards). In each round, the player who possesses the best poker hand shown at any point will start off that particular betting round; continue clockwise thereafter with each player either betting (matching what's been wagered thus far), folding if they no longer wish play/aren't confident with their current hand) or checking if they're happy to keep their stake where it lies (i.e., not adding any more money but still remaining "in" for later streets). As with before; should everyone check through all three rounds on any particular street then there's no money changing hands on that particular turn but we do move on to see what seventh street brings - i.e., final communal card - for possible showdown evaluating purposes come showdown time further down later on... 

* The third stage of betting happens when only two players are left - known as heads-up - after Sixth Street has completed which also features an obligatory double-sized bet that both contestants must place into Showdown Pot in order stay alive within game proceedings; equivalent potsize(s) incrementing upon differing numbersofplayersleftinthreedealtgame). From hereon out until somebody either takes down entire pot or there remains just one person left standing at endgame; said lone individual can either make a forced bet worth half remaining pot size OR choose between making regularbetsizes OR request single opponent match whatever amount their last challenger decidedupon puttinguptothepot(whicheverplayerhaslessthisdoublemortgageoptionrestrictivelyleftontablewillusuallybechosenifheadsUpplayerwinshand). 

In summary: There are 3 stages of betting in TX hold'em - Preflop (everyone puts in an ante), 4 streets post flop (& subsequent rounds end when everyone folds apart from 1 winner who goes onto next street), & heads up mode which occurs when 2 people are left

The 10 Hands in Poker

2. Straight Flush: Five consecutive cards of the same suit (e.g. 2-3-4-5-6 of hearts). Straights and flushes pay out 9-1 when gambling at casino tables.

3. Four of a Kind: Four cards of the same rank (e.g. four jacks). A four of a kind typically pays out 25-1 at casinos.

4. Full House: Three cards of one rank and two cards of another rank (e.g. three queens and two sixes). A full house typically pays out 6-1 when betting at casinos.

5. Flush: Five cards of the same suit, but not in consecutive order (e.g. ace-2-3-4-5 clubs). When gambling at casinos, flushes typically pay out 4-1 odds on your bet amount..

6. Straight: Five consecutive cards not all of the same suit (e.g 5-6-7-8-9 diamonds). When playing casino poker games, straights typically payout 3-1 on your bet amount wagered.. 
7... Two Pair: Two different pairs (e.g two kings and two eights). Two pair typically pay out 2-1 odds on bets when playing poker in a casino setting.. 
8... One Pair: Just one pair (e .g two tens). When playing casino poker games, one pair typically pays 1 - 1 odds on bets placed..    9.... High Card: In the absence of any of the above combinations, the highest card held in your hand becomes your "high card" and therefore the strongest possible hand you can possess - assuming no ties occur between players' hands). If more than one player has high card as their best hand then the pot is split equally between these players".10..... In Poker, there are ten possible "Hands" that you can be dealt based on the combination
