#  Study Shows Gamblers Earn More Than $100,000 a Year in Poker

## A recent study has shown that professional poker players earn an average of more than $100,000 a year.

The study, which was conducted by the University of Chicago, also found that out of the 234 players studied, the median income for those playing professionally was $91,000.

While this is still a good amount of money, it is significantly less than what some of the top earners in the game make. In fact, the top 10 percent of earners in the study made an average of more than $300,000 a year.

So what makes these high earners so successful? According to the study’s authors, it is a combination of skill and chance that leads to their success.

“A big part of it is obviously luck,” said one of the authors of the study, Christopher H. Berry. “But if you are skilled and fortunate enough to be at the table when pots are being won and lost, your earnings will be far greater than someone who is not as skilled.”

This is not surprising news to most poker experts. After all, poker is a game that relies heavily on both chance and skill. Players who are able to combine these two elements effectively have a much better chance of success than those who do not.

In order to improve their chances of winning, many poker players spend years studying the game and learning about different strategies. They also often play in online tournaments or in casinos in order to increase their chances of winning big pots.

While there are no guarantees in poker, players who are able to consistently win big pots can make a very good living playing the game professionally.

#  Gamblers Keep Nearly $1 Million in Winnings Each Day

Americans gamble away nearly $1 million each day, according to a new study.

The study, conducted by the University of Pennsylvania, also found that gamblers keep nearly $1 million in winnings each day.

"The take-home message is that gambling is a widespread and daily behaviour for many Americans," said lead author Dr. Rina Palen.

The study surveyed over 3,000 adults and looked at different types of gambling activities, including slot machines, casino games, race betting, and lottery tickets.

It found that the average American gambles away about $324 per year, with men gambling away more than women.

Gamblers also keep most of their winnings - about $958 per year on average. This amounts to nearly 70 percent of all winnings.

"This research underscores the importance of responsible gambling initiatives," said Palen. "It is critical to help individuals gamble in a way that does not negatively impact their lives."

#  Report: Poker Players Earn More than $30,000 a Year

A report released by the University of Iowa revealed that poker players earn an average of more than $30,000 a year.

The study, which was conducted in collaboration with PokerStars, also found that the overwhelming majority of poker players are male (97 percent) and that the average age of a poker player is 36.

“This report confirms what many in the poker community have long suspected – that professional poker players can make a very good living playing this game,” said Matt Nickerson, SVP of Corporate and Public Affairs at PokerStars.

According to the study, most professional poker players (71%) have other full-time or part-time jobs to support their playing habits. The average annual income from these other jobs is just over $10,000.

PokerStars sponsored the study in order to better understand the demographics and lifestyle of professional poker players. The online gaming company is currently seeking to obtain a license to operate in New Jersey and is hoping to use the information gleaned from the study to help its marketing efforts in the Garden State.

#  How Much Do You Really Win at Poker? 

Most poker players, when asked how much they win per session on average, would answer with a number that’s higher than what they actually earn. 
But why do people do this? 

There are a few possible reasons: 

1) They may be trying to make themselves feel better about their game by overstating their profits. 
2) They may be trying to dissuade other players from playing against them by bragging about their winning prowess. 
3) They may genuinely believe that they are making more money at the poker table than they actually are. 

Whatever the reason may be, it’s important to have an accurate understanding of how much you’re really winning (or losing) at poker so that you can make informed decisions about your play style and bankroll management.

#  Most Poker Players Earn More than $50,000 a Year

Nearly nine out of 10 poker players in the United States earn more than $50,000 annually from playing the game, according to new research.

Online personal finance company Finder.com surveyed 1,000 poker players and found that 83 percent make more than $50,000 from the game each year. Meanwhile, nearly half of all participants (47 percent) earn more than $100,000 annually.

The report also shed light on how much Americans are spending on poker each year. On average, respondents said they spend $1,735 a year on the game. This includes everything from entry fees and buy-ins to travel and beverages consumed while playing.

 Massachusetts resident Eric Baldwin knows all about making a living playing poker. The 33-year-old has been playing professionally for more than a decade and has won numerous tournaments including two World Series of Poker bracelets. In an interview with Finder.com, Baldwin said he makes “six figures annually” from the game.

“Poker is my job and I love it,” Baldwin said. “I couldn’t imagine doing anything else.”

While there are certainly outliers who make millions of dollars playing poker each year, it’s important to remember that this is still a difficult profession in which to succeed. Just think about how many people play online poker regularly – both for fun and profit. The competition is stiff!

That being said, if you’re good at Poker and enjoy playing it as a hobby or even a semi-professional pursuit, there’s no reason why you can’t make a few extra bucks on the side by winning some smaller tournaments or cash games. And if you manage to turn it into a full-time career? Even better!
