# What Are the Lines on a Slot Machine Called? - BaoCasino

If you've ever played a slot machine, you've probably noticed the lines that run across the reels. But have you ever wondered what those lines are called? In this article, we'll take a look at what the lines on a slot machine are called and how they work.

## What Are the Lines on a Slot Machine Called?

The lines on a slot machine are called paylines. Paylines are the lines that run across the reels, indicating where matching symbols need to land in order for the player to win a prize. Paylines can run horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, and they can be straight or zigzagged.

In traditional slot machines, paylines were fixed, meaning that players couldn't change the number of paylines they were playing. However, in modern video slots, players can often choose how many paylines they want to play, with more paylines offering more opportunities to win.

## How Do Paylines Work?

In order to win on a slot machine, players need to land matching symbols on one or more paylines. The more matching symbols a player lands, the bigger the payout. The amount of the payout depends on the specific game and the symbols that were matched.

Some slot machines have a single payline, while others can have dozens or even hundreds of paylines. Generally, the more paylines a game has, the higher the minimum bet will be.
