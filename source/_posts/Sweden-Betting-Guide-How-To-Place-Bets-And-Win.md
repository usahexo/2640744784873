#  Sweden's Sports Betting Laws: Everything You Need To Know

Featuring an overview of the legal landscape as it pertains to sports betting in Sweden, this article is designed to provide readers with all the information they need to make informed choices about their gambling activities.

Sweden is a country that is renowned for its relaxed attitude towards gambling and, as such, has a well-developed and thriving sports betting industry. This article will provide an overview of the legal landscape as it pertains to sports betting in Sweden, including a discussion of both the state-run Svenska Spel and the numerous private operators that offer sports betting services in the country.

Finally, we will take a look at how Sweden's gambling laws could be reformed in light of the ongoing debate surrounding match-fixing in sport, with a particular focus on the potential introduction of new licensing requirements for sports betting operators in Sweden.

# The Swedish Gambling Market

Gambling has been legally available in Sweden since 1766, when the first state-owned gaming monopoly was established. That monopoly has remained in place ever since, with the only exception being the introduction of private slot machine operations in 1963.[1]

The Swedish Gambling Authority (or Lotteriinspektionen) is responsible for regulating all forms of gambling in Sweden, including both land-based and online gambling activities. The authority is also responsible for issuing licenses to both private and state-owned operators and for enforcing Swedish gambling laws.[2]

The Swedish gambling market is dominated by Svenska Spel, which operates the nation's only state-run casino and lottery business. Svenska Spel generated revenue of SEK 10.8 billion ($1.3 billion) in 2013, accounting for more than two-thirds of total gaming revenue in Sweden.[3] However, Svenska Spel faces increasing competition from privately operated sports betting firms, many of which are licensed by the Swedish Gambling Authority.[4]

In total, there are currently 31 licensed private sports betting operators in Sweden,[5] including industry giants such as Bet365 and Unibet. These firms offer a wide range of both traditional and exotic sports betting markets, catering to Swedes who have embraced online gambling with gusto.[6] In fact, according to a recent study by H2 Gaming Capital, online gambling accounted for almost 60% of all Swedish gambling revenue in 2013.[7] This figure is likely to rise further still following last year's decision by the European Court of Justice (ECJ) to declare Sweden's state-run ban on online casino games illegal.[8]

So far, there has been little public outcry over liberalization of Sweden's online casino market and there is no sign that parliament plans to introduce any new regulations governing this market segment anytime soon. However, there could be pressure on lawmakers to reform Sweden's overall gambling framework in light of ongoing concerns about match-fixing in sport.[9] More on this later.

#  How Sweden's Sports Gambling Laws Could Affect You

If you're a sports fan, there's a good chance you like to gamble on the games as well. And if you're like most people, you probably do it illegally. This is because in most of the United States, gambling on sports is illegal. But not in Sweden!

In Sweden, sports gambling is actually a pretty popular pastime. In fact, the country has some of the most liberal sports gambling laws in the world. There are no restrictions on what kinds of bets you can place or on how much money you can wager.

So why is Sweden able to have such relaxed gambling laws? It all has to do with their unique history. Back in the early 20th century, Sweden was a poor country with very few resources. So the government decided to legalize gambling as a way to generate revenue. And it worked! Gambling quickly became one of the country's main sources of income.

But even though Sweden's gambling laws are more relaxed than most other countries, there are still some rules that gamblers need to follow. For example, players are not allowed to bet against their own team. And bookmakers are not allowed to offer odds on certain types of bets, such as how many red cards will be shown in a game or which player will score first.

So what does all this mean for American sports fans? Well, it means that there's a good chance that we will see more relaxed sports gambling laws in the United States in the near future. In fact, several states have already started to loosen their restrictions on sports betting. And last year, the Supreme Court struck down a federal law that banned sports betting nationwide.

So what does this mean for you? It means that you can now legally bet on sports online and in person at casinos and racetracks in most states. You can also bet via telephone and mobile apps. However, some states have yet to launch their new sports betting platforms, so make sure to check with your local casino or racetrack before placing any bets.
