#  Neymar scores winning goal as Santos beats Corinthians 2-1

Neymar scored the winner as Santos beat Corinthians 2-1 in the Paulista state championship. The goal capped a superb performance from the young Brazilian, who was voted man of the match.

The result means that Santos move six points clear at the top of the table with two games remaining. Corinthians now have to win their final two games to have any chance of catching up to their bitter rivals.

“This was a very important victory for us and it keeps us in pole position to win the title,” Neymar said after the match. “I am very happy with my performance tonight.”

Neymar has been in superb form all season and his recent performances have attracted interest from some of Europe’s biggest clubs. Barcelona are believed to be leading the race to sign him but Bayern Munich and Real Madrid are also thought to be keen on securing his services.

#  Flamengo crowned Brasileiro Serie A Champions

Brazilian giants Flamengo were crowned the Brasileiro Serie A champions following a 3-1 win over Palmeiras on Sunday.

Flamengo only required a draw to secure the title, but they put in an impressive performance to record a comfortable victory and clinch their first championship in eight years.

The result also means that Flamengo have qualified for next season's Champions League, while Palmeiras will compete in the Europa League.

Having finished second in last year's championship, Flamengo have bounced back in emphatic style this season and have now been crowned champions of Brazil.

#  Ronaldinho Gaucho leads Atlético Mineiro to Championship

Ronaldinho Gaucho has led Atlético Mineiro to its first ever Campeonato Mineiro championship. The former Barcelona and Milan playmaker has been a revelation since joining the Belo Horizonte side in January, scoring ten goals in eighteen appearances as they secured the title by five points over second-placed Cruzeiro.

"Playing for Atlético is very special because of the love that the fans have for their club," Ronaldinho said after the final match. "I'm very happy to have been able to contribute to this championship."

The victory was no doubt extra sweet for Ronaldinho, who was snubbed by Brazil coach Luiz Felipe Scolari for this summer's World Cup squad. The 34-year-old has insisted he will continue playing until he is 40 and his performances for Atlético suggest he still has much to offer.

Ronaldinho began his career with Gremio in his home state of Rio Grande do Sul before moving on to Paris Saint-Germain in 2001. He won two Ligue 1 titles and one Champions League with the French club, before transferring to Barcelona in 2003. With the Catalans, Ronaldinho became one of the most decorated players in history, winning two Champions League crowns, one Liga championship, three Copa del Reys and two FIFA Club World Cups.

He left Barcelona in 2008 for AC Milan, where he struggled with injuries and disappointing form. After a loan spell at Flamengo, Ronaldinho returned to Brazil with Atlético Mineiro in 2013. Since then, he has regained his best form and become a fan favourite once again.

#  Silva's brace helps São Paulo FC keep lead in league

São Paulo FC remain in first place in the Brazilian Série A table, thanks to a brace from Edimar Silva. The home side had to fight hard to get the three points, as they were up against second-placed Fluminense FC.

The visitors started the better of the two sides and created the first chance of the match through Pedro. The young forward was played through on goal by Daniel, but his shot was straight at goalkeeper Rogério Ceni.

São Paulo FC then started to come into the game and had a few chances of their own. Lucas Pratto shot wide from close range before Edimar Silva's header was saved by Diego Cavalieri.

The deadlock was finally broken in the 36th minute when Edimar Silva received a cross from Michel Bastos on the edge of the penalty area. The defender took a touch before firing home low past Diego Cavalieri.

Fluminense FC came out fighting in the second half and had several good chances to get back into the game. Júlio César came close with a free-kick before Wellington Nem headed just over from six yards out.

São Paulo FC then increased their lead in the 82nd minute when Edimar Silva completed his brace. The defender rose highest to head home a corner from Michel Bastos, giving Diego Cavalieri no chance.

The three points see São Paulo FC maintain their five-point lead at the top of the table, while Fluminense FC drop down to second place.

#  Juninho Pernambucano guides Vasco da Gama to fourth place

When Vasco da Gama hired Juninho Pernambucano as their manager in February, there were few who expected them to achieve any significant success. The team was mired in a relegation battle, and few saw Juninho’s appointment as anything other than a desperate attempt by the club to keep themselves in Brazil’s top flight.

But Juninho defied the odds, leading his team on a remarkable run that saw them finish fourth in the Brasileirão and qualify for next season’s Copa Libertadores. His innovative tactics and tireless work ethic won him plaudits from all corners of the footballing world, and he is now considered one of the most promising young managers in Brazil.

During his time at Vasco, Juninho made great use of unorthodox tactics and gave opportunities to young players who had previously been overlooked by other managers. One such player was 18-year-old midfielder Wendel, who became a key player in Juninho’s team and is now reportedly being targeted by several top European clubs.

Juninho’s achievements at Vasco da Gama have not gone unnoticed, and it is likely that he will be offered increasingly lucrative managerial jobs in the coming years. But for now, he remains focused on guiding his team to glory in the Copa Libertadores.
