      		<h1 id="Illinois-sports-betting-could-open-door-for-more-gambling-in-workplace"><a href="#Illinois-sports-betting-could-open-door-for-more-gambling-in-workplace" class="headerlink" title="Illinois sports betting could open door for more gambling in workplace"></a>Illinois sports betting could open door for more gambling in workplace</h1><p>While the legalization of sports betting in Illinois could lead to more gambling in the workplace, experts say it’s not likely to result in widespread problem gambling.</p>
<p>That’s good news for those who worry that expanding legalized gambling will further normalize casino-style wagering and lead to more people developing addiction problems. But it could also mean that casinos and racetracks will see a windfall as Illinois residents place bets on everything from the Super Bowl to the Kentucky Derby.</p>
<p>“There is no question it will be a net positive for the industry,” said Brian Musburger, chairman of the Nevada Gaming Control Board and a gaming industry analyst.</p>
<p>After years of legal maneuvering and debate, Illinois lawmakers last month gave final approval to a bill that would allow sports betting in the state. The measure awaits action by Gov. J.B. Pritzker, who has indicated he will sign it into law. Betting on sports would be available at casinos and horseracing tracks, with the latter limited to betting on thoroughbred, harness and quarter horse racing.</p>
<p>In neighboring Iowa, lawmakers are considering a bill that would allow sports betting without specifying where it could take place, leaving that up to the Iowa Racing and Gaming Commission. In Missouri, lawmakers have introduced a bill that would allow sports betting at casinos and on mobile devices but doesn’t mention horseracing tracks.</p>
<p>The move toward legal sports betting comes as other forms of gambling are expanding nationwide. More than two dozen states offer some form of legalized casino gambling, including slot machines, table games and poker. In 2017, 37 states offered some form of legal lottery gaming, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, problem gambling rates have been ticking upward. The National Council on Problem Gambling estimates that 2 percent of U.S. adults have a compulsive gambling problem, while another 4-6 percent may have mild-to-moderate problems.”</p>
<p>It was just a matter of time before Illinois lawmakers took up the issue of legalizing sports betting following the lead of other states in the country. After years of debate and maneuvering among politicians in Springfield, Illinois finally gave final approval to a bill allowing for sports betting within state borders – with governor JB Pritzker indicating he will sign it into law imminently. For casino owners and racetrack operators in Illinois this is great news – Sports Betting is widely expected to be a major boon for their businesses; however there is worry among some experts that this could lead to increased rates of problem gambling across society as a whole.<br>   While many forms of gambling are now legal in over half the states in America (including casino table games &amp; poker, state lotteries &amp; scratch tickets as well as various other bets such as those on horseracing), Problem Gambling rates have been slowly increasing since 2000 . The National Council on Problem Gambling (NCPG) estimates that approximately 2%of US adults suffer from compulsive gambling issues while another 4-6% may have more mild issues with gambling behavior . This growing issue is one which legislators &amp; others seeking to legalize new forms of gambling (such as with Sports Betting) often brush under the rug – hoping customers won’t develop such problems with their new products but knowing full well that many inevitably will .</p>
<h1 id="Cowboys-employers-beware-Illinois-sports-betting-could-lead-to-gambling-addiction"><a href="#Cowboys-employers-beware-Illinois-sports-betting-could-lead-to-gambling-addiction" class="headerlink" title="Cowboys employers beware: Illinois sports betting could lead to gambling addiction"></a>Cowboys employers beware: Illinois sports betting could lead to gambling addiction</h1><p>The legalization of sports betting in Illinois could lead to employees spending more time gambling and less time working, putting their jobs at risk.</p>
<p>A recent study by the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign found that when states legalize sports betting, employees are more likely to engage in problem gambling. The study surveyed 1,000 people in states that have recently legalized sports betting as well as states that have not legalized it.</p>
<p>Overall, the study found that 6 percent of those surveyed in states that have legalized sports betting reported problem gambling, compared to just 2 percent of those surveyed in states that haven’t legalized it. In particular, employees were more likely to gamble on their work hours and to use work computers and phones to place bets.</p>
<p>Gambling addiction can lead to a number of negative consequences for employees, including decreased productivity, job loss, and financial problems. According to the National Council on Problem Gambling, “gambling addiction is a serious mental health disorder that can destroy lives.”</p>
<p>Employers should be aware of the risks associated with sports betting and take steps to ensure their employees are not engaging in problematic gambling behavior. This may include implementing policies prohibiting gambling on work hours or installing software that blocks access to gambling websites.</p>
<h1 id="Illinois-sports-betting-could-cost-employers-millions-in-lost-productivity"><a href="#Illinois-sports-betting-could-cost-employers-millions-in-lost-productivity" class="headerlink" title="Illinois sports betting could cost employers millions in lost productivity"></a>Illinois sports betting could cost employers millions in lost productivity</h1><p>As Illinois moves closer to legalizing sports betting, some employers are voicing concerns about potential lost productivity.</p>
<p>According to a study by the American Gaming Association (AGA), Illinoisans wagered $2.6 billion on sports in 2017 – a figure that is expected to grow following the legalization of sports betting.</p>
<p>If just 1 percent of that amount is wagered during work hours, it could cost employers up to $26 million in lost productivity.</p>
<p>“We are concerned about the impact sports betting could have on workplace productivity if it’s legalized in Illinois,” said Rob Karr, president and CEO of the Illinois Retail Merchants Association (IRMA).</p>
<p>Karr said his organization is advocating for an early morning and evening ban on sports betting in order to minimize its impact on the workforce.</p>
<p>But others say the concerns are overblown.</p>
<p>“I don’t think it’s going to be as big of a deal as people are making it out to be,” said Assemblywoman Anne Stava-Murray (D-Naperville). “People already take time out of their day to place bets with off-trackBetting facilities or through offshore websites. This will just give them another option.”</p>
<p>Proponents of legalized sports betting argue that it will generate much-needed tax revenue for the state and create jobs. They also contend that it will be easier to regulate than illegal gambling operations.</p>
<p>The bill authorizing sports betting in Illinois is currently awaiting action by Gov. JB Pritzker, who has said he supports it.</p>
<h1 id="Gambling-in-the-office-Illinois-sports-betting-raises-questions-for-employers"><a href="#Gambling-in-the-office-Illinois-sports-betting-raises-questions-for-employers" class="headerlink" title="Gambling in the office? Illinois sports betting raises questions for employers"></a>Gambling in the office? Illinois sports betting raises questions for employers</h1><p>An Illinois bill that would legalize sports betting is raising questions for employers about whether they can restrict or prohibit employees from gambling on sports at work.</p>
<p>The proposed Illinois Sports Betting Act would allow people 21 and older to place bets on professional, collegiate, and other sporting events. Gambling on sports is currently illegal in Illinois, with some exceptions for licensed horse racing and charitable gaming.</p>
<p>The bill’s sponsor, Representative Mike Zalewski, says the legislation is needed because of the proliferation of illegal sports betting.</p>
<p>“This legislation creates a safe, regulated environment that allows Illinoisans to bet on sports in a way that protects consumers and ensures the integrity of the games we all love,” said Rep. Zalewski.</p>
<p>But not everyone is happy about the proposed bill. Some employers are concerned that it will lead to more gambling by employees at work.</p>
<p>“We are opposed to any type of wagering on company time or property,” said Michael Jacobson, president and CEO of the Chicagoland Chamber of Commerce. “It would breed an unhealthy work environment and increase the chance of workplace accidents.”</p>
<p>Others argue that employees should be allowed to gamble on sports if it doesn’t interfere with their work duties.</p>
<p>“People are going to do it anyway, so we might as well have some regulations in place and generate some revenue for the state,” said Springfield resident Kyle White.</p>
<p>The proposed Illinois Sports Betting Act still needs approval from the state legislature and Governor JB Pritzker before it can become law.</p>
<h1 id="Illinois-sports-betting-What-does-it-mean-for-employers-and-work-productivity"><a href="#Illinois-sports-betting-What-does-it-mean-for-employers-and-work-productivity" class="headerlink" title="Illinois sports betting: What does it mean for employers and work productivity?"></a>Illinois sports betting: What does it mean for employers and work productivity?</h1><p>Illinois became the latest state to legalize sports betting, albeit in a limited manner. The new law allows for bets to be placed through the state lottery and at casinos, but not other types of gambling establishments. The lack of availability at horseracing tracks and via online platforms could limit the impact of the new law on the state’s economy.</p>
<p>The legalization of sports betting in Illinois will likely have mixed effects on employers and employees within the state. on one hand, businesses may see a boost in productivity as employees take time out of their day to place bets on sporting events. On the other hand, there is also a risk that some employees may become distracted by their bets, potentially leading to decreased work productivity.</p>
<p>It is important for employers to set clear expectations with their employees about acceptable levels of work productivity in light of the new law. Employees should be reminded that they are still required to meet deadlines and fulfill other responsibilities while placing bets on sporting events. Employers may also want to consider implementing rules prohibiting employees from placing wagers on games during working hours.</p>
<p>Overall, the legalization of sports betting in Illinois is likely to have both positive and negative effects on employers and employees within the state. It is important for employers to be aware of these potential impacts and take appropriate measures to ensure that work productivity is not adversely affected.</p>
