      		<h1 id="Louisiana-Gambles-on-Sports-Betting-to-Bring-in-Tax-Revenue"><a href="#Louisiana-Gambles-on-Sports-Betting-to-Bring-in-Tax-Revenue" class="headerlink" title="Louisiana Gambles on Sports Betting to Bring in Tax Revenue"></a>Louisiana Gambles on Sports Betting to Bring in Tax Revenue</h1><p>In March of 2018, the Louisiana state legislature voted to legalize sports betting in an effort to bring in more tax revenue. The new law allows people age 21 and up to place bets on sporting events at the state’s casinos and racetracks.</p>
<p>Supporters of the measure argue that it will create jobs and generate millions of dollars in tax revenue each year. opponents say that the potential for gambling addiction and other social problems is too high a price to pay.</p>
<p>So far, it is not clear how much revenue the new law will generate. In neighboring Mississippi, where sports betting has been legal since 1990, the total annual take from gambling is estimated at $300 million. However, only a small fraction of that comes from sports betting; most of the money is generated through casino games.</p>
<p>Louisiana officials are hopeful that they can tap into some of that money. The state has long been dependent on gaming revenue; according to one report, it brought in more than $780 million in 2017, making it the fourth-largest source of income after oil and gas production, taxes, and tourism.</p>
<p>Critics of legalized sports betting point out that it could have harmful consequences for many people in Louisiana. Gambling addictions can ruin lives, causing financial hardship and leading to marital problems and other social ills. In addition, there is always a risk that innocent people could lose money by betting on sports games they know nothing about.</p>
<p>Despite these concerns, lawmakers in Louisiana seem determined to give legalizing sports betting a try. With so many states now allowing it, there is pressure to join the trend or see tax revenues decline even further.</p>
<h1 id="Louisiana-Prepares-for-Launch-of-Sports-Betting-Operation"><a href="#Louisiana-Prepares-for-Launch-of-Sports-Betting-Operation" class="headerlink" title="Louisiana Prepares for Launch of Sports Betting Operation"></a>Louisiana Prepares for Launch of Sports Betting Operation</h1><p>With the US Supreme Court’s decision in May to strike down a 1992 law that banned sports betting nationwide, states have been working to legalize and regulate the industry. </p>
<p>Louisiana is one of several states that has finalized regulations for its sports betting operation in preparation for its launch. The Louisiana Gaming Control Board released proposed regulations in July, and the state’s lawmakers approved them in September. </p>
<p>The regulations allow for both land-based and online sports betting, and casinos, racetracks, and off-track betting parlors will be able to offer bets. There will be a 10% tax on sports wagers, with the proceeds going to the state’s general fund. </p>
<p>Residents of Louisiana will be able to place bets on professional and college sports starting on November 1st. There are some restrictions – residents will not be able to bet on high school games or events that take place in Louisiana – but it’s expected that there will be a lot of interest in the new industry. </p>
<p>Several casinos have already announced plans to offer sports betting, including Harrah’s New Orleans, Boomtown Casino Biloxi, Golden Nugget Lake Charles, Horseshoe Bossier City, and Sam’s Town Tunica. Online gaming companies like DraftKings and FanDuel are also preparing to offer sports betting in Louisiana. </p>
<p>It will be interesting to see how the sports betting industry develops in Louisiana. Some states – like Nevada – have seen a lot of growth since legalizing sports betting,<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://choegocasino.com/">카지노 사이트</a> while others – like Delaware – have seen much less success. It remains to be seen whether or not Louisiana will experience similar growth.</p>
<h1 id="Louisiana-Poised-to-Benefit-from-legalized-Sports-Betting"><a href="#Louisiana-Poised-to-Benefit-from-legalized-Sports-Betting" class="headerlink" title="Louisiana Poised to Benefit from legalized Sports Betting"></a>Louisiana Poised to Benefit from legalized Sports Betting</h1><p>Louisiana is expected to benefit from legalized sports betting as the state moves to regulate and tax the industry. </p>
<p>“This is good news for Louisiana,” said Gov. John Bel Edwards in a statement. “It will produce new revenue that we can use to support priorities like education, health care, and infrastructure.” </p>
<p>The bill, which was introduced by Rep. Neil Abramson, would impose a 10 percent tax on sports bets, with proceeds going to the state’s general fund. The legislation also calls for the establishment of a Louisiana Gaming Control Board to oversee sports betting in the state. </p>
<p>Edwards noted that other states that have legalized sports betting have seen an increase in revenue. New Jersey, for example, generated more than $185 million in taxes from legal sports betting in 2018. </p>
<p>The governor said that Louisiana is well-positioned to take advantage of the growing trend, given its proximity to gaming destinations like Las Vegas and Atlantic City. </p>
<p>“This is a smart move that will help us create jobs and grow our economy,” Edwards said.</p>
<h1 id="Louisiana-readies-for-launch-of-sports-betting-industry"><a href="#Louisiana-readies-for-launch-of-sports-betting-industry" class="headerlink" title="Louisiana readies for launch of sports betting industry"></a>Louisiana readies for launch of sports betting industry</h1><p>Louisiana is preparing to launch its sports betting industry, following the Supreme Court’s repeal of the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act (PASPA) in May.</p>
<p>The state has tapped Scientific Games (SGMS) to provide a fully integrated sports betting and i-gaming solution, which will include casino management systems, player account management, self-service betting terminals and a central reporting system.</p>
<p>“With the implementation of our award-winning SG Digital sports betting and iGaming solution, Louisiana’s casinos will be able to quickly offer an engaging customer experience that meets the needs of sports bettors,” said Kevin Sheehan, CEO of Scientific Games.</p>
<p>“This is an important day for gaming in Louisiana as we welcome legalized sports betting to our state,” said Governor John Bel Edwards. “Our partnership with Scientific Games will provide our casinos with the most advanced sports betting technology available and create jobs throughout our state.”</p>
<p>In addition to providing the technology for sports betting, Scientific Games will also provide marketing and support services to help boost Louisiana’s new industry.</p>
<h1 id="How-Louisiana-plans-to-regulate-and-tax-sports-betting"><a href="#How-Louisiana-plans-to-regulate-and-tax-sports-betting" class="headerlink" title="How Louisiana plans to regulate and tax sports betting"></a>How Louisiana plans to regulate and tax sports betting</h1><p>Louisiana’s lawmakers want to ensure that the state reaps some of the benefits from sports betting, authorizing a new regulatory body and imposing a tax on gaming operators.</p>
<p>The legislation, filed earlier this month in the state Senate, would set up the Louisiana Gaming Control Board to license and regulate entities that want to offer sports betting. The board would be overseen by the Department of Justice.</p>
<p>The proposal calls for a 10 percent tax on gaming operators, which would be imposed on handle or bets placed. That would be lower than what other states are charging; New Jersey, for instance, has a tax rate of 14.25 percent.</p>
<p>But Louisiana legislators said they wanted to make sure the industry is healthy before setting a higher rate.</p>
<p>“We didn’t want to over-tax it and kill it in its crib, so to speak,” said state Sen. Danny Martiny, a sponsor of the bill.</p>
<p>Louisiana joins a growing number of states looking to legalize and regulate sports betting in light of last year’s U.S. Supreme Court decision striking down a federal ban on the activity. Delaware was the first state to launch full-scale sports betting operations after the ruling.</p>
<p>Nevada has had legal sports betting since 1949, while Mississippi and West Virginia both launched sports wagering in late 2018.</p>
<p>Several more states have bills pending in their legislatures, including California, Illinois and New York.</p>
