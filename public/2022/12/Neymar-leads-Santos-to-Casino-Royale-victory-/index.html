Neymar was in inspired form for the home side and helped them to a 3-1 victory with two goals and an assist.</p>
<p>Botafogo had taken an early lead in the match after some poor defending from Santos, but Neymar soon equalized for his side with a superb free-kick. The young Brazilian then turned provider for his team’s second goal, setting up striker Borges to score with a well-placed header. Neymar completed the scoring himself in the second half to ensure that Santos would progress to the final.</p>
<p>The 22-year-old has been in scintillating form for Santos this season, scoring eighteen goals and providing nineteen assists in just thirty appearances. He has also been linked with a move to Europe’s top clubs, with Barcelona and Real Madrid both said to be interested in signing him.</p>
<p>Santos will now face fellow Brazilian side Flamengo in the final of the Casino Royale tournament, which is seen as one of South America’s most prestigious club competitions.</p>

Ganso was the star of the show, scoring both goals for the home side.</p>
<p>The result sees Sao Paulo join Palmeiras and Flamengo on 20 points, with all three clubs having played 11 games. Cruzeiro are just behind on 19 points, while Atlético Mineiro are lurking in fifth place on 17 points.</p>
<p>Ganso opened the scoring after 12 minutes, firing home from close range after being set up by Éverton. The midfielder then made it 2-0 four minutes into injury time at the end of the first half, blasting a shot into the top corner from outside the penalty area.</p>
<p>Fluminense pulled one back nine minutes into the second half through Marcos Junior, but Sao Paulo held on for a vital three points.</p>

The victory sees them move top of the table, at least until next weekend when Grêmio play Fluminense. It was a game of two halves, with Palmeiras taking an early lead through a contentious goal from Dudu before Henrique equalized just before halftime. The winner came courtesy of substitute Camacho midway through the second half. Here’s how it played out:</p>
<p>The game started at a frantic pace, with both sides looking to get on the front foot. It was Corinthians who created the first chance of note in the third minute, when Pedrinho headed wide from close range after a good cross from Fabio Santos. However, it was Palmeiras who took the lead soon after. In the 11th minute, referee Wilton Sampaio awarded them a questionable free kick just outside the area after consulting with his assistant. The wall did its job in blocking TV replays showed that there was no contact from Clayson on Moisés as he went down and Dudu made no mistake from the resulting set piece, firing into the top corner past Cassio.</p>
<p>The goal seemed to give Palmeiras a boost and they began to take control of proceedings. They should have doubled their advantage in the 26th minute but Joel Campbell couldn’t connect properly with another Dudu delivery, sending his header wide of the target. Shortly afterwards, Alisson had to be alert to keep out a low drive from Pedrinho as Corinthians looked for an instant response. However, it was Palmeiras who struck again just before halftime. This time it was Henrique who got on the scoresheet, heading in powerfully from a corner by Diego Tardelli four minutes before the break.</p>
<p>It was all square at halftime but Corinthians started the second half brightly and had two good chances to get back into the game within minutes of the restart. First up was Jadson, who saw his effort saved by Alisson after being played in by Araos. Then it was Taison’s turn to try his luck but he too was denied by Alisson, this time with a brilliant save using his feet. That proved to be a pivotal moment as Palmeiras then took control of proceedings and got their third goal 10 minutes later. Substitute Camacho met a cross from Michel Bastos on the volley and sent Corinthians keeper Cassio the wrong way to give his side all three points.</p>
<h1 id="Cruzeiro-go-top-with-win-over-lowly-Goias"><a href="#Cruzeiro-go-top-with-win-over-lowly-Goias" class="headerlink" title="Cruzeiro go top with win over lowly Goias"></a>Cruzeiro go top with win over lowly Goias</h1><p>Cruzeiro got back to winning ways in the Brasileirão with a 3-1 victory over Goias on Sunday. Marcelo Moreno scored twice and Diego Souza added another as the hosts moved top of the table, at least until Monday when Fluminense and Atlético Mineiro meet. Marquinho grabbed a consolation for Goias.</p>
<p>It was an eagerly awaited match at the Mineirão, as Cruzeiro looked to take advantage of Fluminense’s weekend slip up and move top of the table. And they made a flying start as Marcelo Moreno headed them in front after just four minutes. The hosts continued to dominate, but could not add to their lead before the break.</p>
<p>They did make it 2-0 midway through the second half, as Diego Souza finished off a well worked move. Goias pulled one back soon after though, as Marquinho converted from close range. But Marcelo Moreno had the last word, converting a penalty with ten minutes remaining to seal all three points for Cruzeiro.</p>
<p>The result means that Cruzeiro are now top of the table on goal difference, with both Fluminense and Atlético Mineiro still to play this round.</p>
<h1 id="Botafogo-come-from-behind-to-stun-champions-Internacional"><a href="#Botafogo-come-from-behind-to-stun-champions-Internacional" class="headerlink" title="Botafogo come from behind to stun champions Internacional"></a>Botafogo come from behind to stun champions Internacional</h1><p>Botafogo staged a stunning comeback to stun Internacional 3-1 and dent the champions’ chances of defending their title. Rafael Moura scored twice in three minutes to turn the game on its head, after Derlis Gonzalez had given Internacional the lead.</p>
<p>Ney Franco’s side started brightly and took the lead when Gonzalez was left unmarked at the back post to head home Marcelo Cirino’s cross. However, they were soon pegged back as Moura converted from the penalty spot after he had been fouled by Washington.</p>
<p>And Botafogo completed their comeback in astonishing fashion as Moura met an inch-perfect cross from Andrezinho to volley home and seal a memorable victory. The result leaves Internacional in fourth place, four points adrift of leaders Corinthians with six games remaining.</p>
<p>Botafogo are now just two points behind their opponents, in eighth place and with a game in hand.</p>
