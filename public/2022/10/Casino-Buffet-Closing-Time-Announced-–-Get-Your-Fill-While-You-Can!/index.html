As of Sunday, September 1st at 6pm the buffet will close its doors for good.</p>
<p>This news comes as a shock to many, as the buffet has been a staple of the casino since it opened over two decades ago. But with changing times and tastes, the casino has decided that it is no longer feasible to keep the buffet open.</p>

<h1 id="Buffet-Going-Going-Gone-at-Casino-Microgaming-CrazyTooth"><a href="#Buffet-Going-Going-Gone-at-Casino-Microgaming-CrazyTooth" class="headerlink" title="Buffet Going, Going, Gone at Casino Microgaming CrazyTooth"></a>Buffet Going, Going, Gone at Casino Microgaming CrazyTooth</h1><p>Microgaming-powered Crazy Tooth Casino is waving goodbye to its buffet. The closure of the buffet is effective as of October 1, 2018, affecting all players irrespective of their location.</p>
<p>The casino has been mum on the reasons behind the closure but a notice on the website confirms that it is shutting down for good. The casino has not given any indication that it will be bringing back the buffet in the future.</p>
<p>When reached for comment, a Microgaming spokesperson said, “We can confirm that the Crazy Tooth Casino buffet is closing as of October 1, 2018. We do not have any additional information to share at this time.”</p>
<p>The decision to shutter the buffet comes barely two months after another Microgaming-powered casino, Slotland, shut down its buffet citing low player turnout and profitability issues. It’s clear that buffet closures are becoming more common in the industry and could be symptomatic of casinos’ increasing reluctance to foot the bill for what is seen as an unnecessary luxury.</p>
<p>It’s still unclear why Crazy Tooth Casino has decided to close its buffet but there’s no doubt that players are going to miss out on some great food options. The good news is that there are plenty of other excellent casinos out there with buffets that players can enjoy so they won’t have to go too long without one.</p>
<h1 id="End-of-the-Buffet-Line-Casino-Microgaming-CrazyTooth-Closing-its-Doors"><a href="#End-of-the-Buffet-Line-Casino-Microgaming-CrazyTooth-Closing-its-Doors" class="headerlink" title="End of the Buffet Line: Casino Microgaming CrazyTooth Closing its Doors"></a>End of the Buffet Line: Casino Microgaming CrazyTooth Closing its Doors</h1><p>The CrazyTooth casino, a long-standing fixture of the Canadian online gambling scene, has announced that it will be closing its doors at the end of the month. In a brief statement on the CrazyTooth website, management cited “tough economic times” as the reason for their decision.</p>
<p>CrazyTooth’s closure will leave microgaming casino players in Canada with few options; the only other major microgaming site still operating in Canada is Casino Joy.</p>
<p>The news was not entirely unexpected; rumours of CrazyTooth’s imminent closure have been circulating for months. Nevertheless, the announcement has left many gamers wondering what they will do come March 31st.</p>
<p>Some players are already looking to other platforms, such as PokerStars or 888poker, in hopes of finding a replacement for CrazyTooth’s wide range of games and generous bonuses. Others are simply hoping that another Canadian microgaming casino will open its doors before CrazyTooth officially shuts down for good.</p>
<h1 id="Farewell-to-the-Casino-Buffet-Microgaming-CrazyTooth-Calls-it-Quits"><a href="#Farewell-to-the-Casino-Buffet-Microgaming-CrazyTooth-Calls-it-Quits" class="headerlink" title="Farewell to the Casino Buffet: Microgaming CrazyTooth Calls it Quits"></a>Farewell to the Casino Buffet: Microgaming CrazyTooth Calls it Quits</h1><p>2018 will sadly be remembered as the year when two of the industry’s most iconic names called it quits - after all, we said goodbye to NetEnt’s Gonzo’s Quest and Microgaming’s Crazy Tooth.</p>
<p>The news was broken by none other than Microgaming themselves, who announced that the game would be removed from their software portfolio as of September 2018. The reason for its removal? A lack of uptake among players.</p>
<p>It goes without saying that Crazy Tooth leaves behind a proud legacy - after all, it was one of the first slot machines to feature 3D graphics, and its psychedelic visuals were a big hit with players. However, in an industry that’s constantly evolving, it was perhaps inevitable that Crazy Tooth would eventually fall out of favour.</p>
<p>So what does this mean for Microgaming as a whole? Well, in a statement released alongside the news, the company assured players that they remain “committed to delivering leading content across our product portfolio.” In other words, don’t expect them to rest on their laurels - they’ll continue to bring you exciting new games in 2019 and beyond!</p>
<h1 id="Buffet-Blues-Casino-Microgaming-CrazyTooth-Says-Goodbye-to-its-Dining-Option"><a href="#Buffet-Blues-Casino-Microgaming-CrazyTooth-Says-Goodbye-to-its-Dining-Option" class="headerlink" title="Buffet Blues? Casino Microgaming CrazyTooth Says Goodbye to its Dining Option"></a>Buffet Blues? Casino Microgaming CrazyTooth Says Goodbye to its Dining Option</h1><p>It would seem that, in the era of the Internet, Buffet Blues? Casino Microgaming CrazyTooth Says Goodbye to its Dining Option is no longer viable. This is what happened this month when Microgaming CrazyTooth casino decided to close down its buffet option.</p>
<p>The first time that an online casino closed down its buffet option was back in 2016 when Golden Nugget Las Vegas shuttered their buffet. At the time, many pundits felt that this was a sign that the end was near for buffet dining options in Las Vegas.</p>
<p>Now it would seem that the trend is catching on with online casinos as well. This is because, with people opting to eat meals at home instead of going out, buffets are no longer seen as a viable way to make money. This is particularly true for smaller casinos like Microgaming CrazyTooth, which don’t have the same level of customer traffic as larger casinos do.</p>
<p>For those who enjoyed eating at the casino buffet, there is some good news: most of the popular buffets in Las Vegas are still open for business. Some of these buffets include The Wynn, The Mirage, and Caesars Palace. So if you’re looking for a great deal on a hotel and a meal, then be sure to check out these places.</p>
<p>In the meantime, it will be interesting to see if any other online casinos follow Microgaming CrazyTooth’s lead and close down their buffet options. Only time will tell!</p>
